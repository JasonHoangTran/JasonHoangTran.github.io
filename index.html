                    Our users are frustrated that while they are in quarantine they do not get a chance to choose what food they eat. They receive premade boxed meals delivered to their doors for each meal. Our solution should provide these students with the ability to choose and order food through the university meal plan and have it delivered to their door.

                    We, as a group, came up with as many ideas, as we could, to implement into our quarantine food delivery service app, Quarantine Dash.
